A 2D game engine for Android

Welcome to BobEngine! BobEngine is an OpenGL based 2D game engine for Android that aims to simplify and speed up 2D Android game development! It started as a base for my Android game Plane Popper but after finishing my game I went to work generalizing the engine so that it could be reused for future projects. I created it mostly for my own projects, but I decided that I would share it with others.

BobEngine is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 (LGPL-2.1)

More examples and tutorials are coming soon, as my schedule permits.
